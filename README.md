This repo involves extensive analysis performed on raw Kickstarter Data using Excel. Through the use of filters, trends involving fundraising as well as goals met were identified.

We can also see that there is a greater volume of plays requesting fundraising than other subcategories. Documentaries in specific fared extremely well when it came to success, as can be seen here: ![chart](chart4.png)

In terms of time of year that is suggestively beneficial for kickstarters, we can see that May is the best time of year, whereas December seems to be rather poor of a time: ![chart](chart2.png)
